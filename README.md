The dataset contains the daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital Bikeshare system with the
corresponding weather and seasonal information. Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental
and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can
affect the rental behaviors.

The file contains bike sharing counts aggregated on daily basis (day.csv - 731 rows, 16 columns)
